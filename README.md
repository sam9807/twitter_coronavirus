# Coronavirus twitter analysis

Approximately 500 million tweets are sent everyday. Of those tweets, about 1% are geotagged. 
That is, the user's device includes location information about where the tweets were sent from. 
Using the MapReduce procedure denoted below, I have analyzed the twitter corona virus dataset.
Once I have successfully reduced all the data by language and country, I have organized the data

the viz folder on this page.
